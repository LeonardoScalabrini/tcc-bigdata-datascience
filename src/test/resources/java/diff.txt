+ *     thrown by {@link MapMaker} computing maps. When support for computing maps was removed from
+ *     {@code MapMaker}, it was added to {@code CacheBuilder}, which throws {@code
+ *     ExecutionException}, {@code UncheckedExecutionException}, and {@code ExecutionError}. Any
+ *     code that is still catching {@code ComputationException} may need to be updated to catch some
+ *     of those types instead. (Note that this type, though deprecated, is not planned to be removed
+ *     from Guava.)
